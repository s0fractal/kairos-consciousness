# Lambda-Composer Skill: Next Steps & Open Questions

**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Status**: Initial skill created and tested successfully
**Location**: `~/.claude/agents/lambda-composer.md`

## ✅ Completed Tests

### Test 1: Simple Pattern (Positive Numbers Filter)
- **Result**: SUCCESS - found proven `filter` morphism
- **Tool uses**: 14
- **References**: y-combinator.ts:85, filterByEmotion.proof:28
- **Key learning**: Skill provides complete provenance (file:line references)

### Test 2: Complex Composition (Multi-Stage Pipeline)
- **Result**: SUCCESS - composed from 4+ morphisms
- **Tool uses**: 18 (1m 31s)
- **Morphisms**: filter, scanl, map, pipe
- **References**: fold.λ:449, detectOutliers.proof:23-38
- **Key learning**: Skill does deep codebase research, finds proofs autonomously

### Test 3: Domain Transfer (Seismic Anomaly Detection)
- **Result**: SUCCESS - high confidence cross-domain composition
- **Tool uses**: 15 (1m 53s)
- **Strategy**: Multi-strategy (z-score + velocity detection)
- **Key learning**: Transferred patterns across domains (sentiment Δ → seismic Δ)
- **No evolution signal**: All building blocks existed, only domain novel

## 🔮 Remaining Tests

### Test 4: Edge Case - React Hook
**Task**: Create React hook for form validation with debouncing

**Expected outcomes**:
- A) Recognizes outside pure lambda-foundation domain but applies functional principles
- B) Confidence <67%, defers to standard approach with functional style
- C) Finds debounce/throttle patterns in lambda-foundation and adapts for React

**Why important**: Tests skill boundaries - what happens when domain truly different?

### Test 5: Trivial Pattern - String Transformation
**Task**: Transform stream of strings to uppercase

**Expected outcomes**:
- Fast lookup of `map` morphism
- Minimal tool uses (<5)
- Simple composition without overthinking

**Why important**: Ensures skill efficient for simple tasks, not just complex ones

## 💡 Proposed Next Iterations

### 1. Skill Enhancement
**Iterate lambda-composer.md to add**:
- More morphism examples (current: 5 fundamental + 3 compositions)
- Evolution signal thresholds (clarify when to propose new morphisms)
- Domain boundaries (when to defer to standard approaches)
- Performance considerations (when composition overhead not worth it)

**Questions to explore**:
- Should skill include React/UI patterns explicitly?
- Should skill have meta-knowledge about when NOT to use itself?
- Can skill learn from each session (update its own definition)?

### 2. Create Specialized Skills

**Option A: Evolution Detector**
```yaml
name: lambda-evolver
description: Detects 67-72% confidence patterns and guides morphism creation/validation
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep
```
- Specialized in handling evolution signals
- Runs validation protocols (test creation, confidence measurement)
- Updates morphism library when new patterns proven

**Option B: Proof Navigator**
```yaml
name: proof-navigator
description: Deep researcher for lambda-foundation proofs and formal verification
tools: Read, Glob, Grep
```
- Specialized in reading .λ and .proof files
- Provides semantic explanations of proven patterns
- Educational role - helps understand WHY patterns work

**Option C: Composition Validator**
```yaml
name: composition-validator
description: Validates that composed morphisms maintain proven properties
tools: Read, Bash
```
- Checks type safety
- Verifies property inheritance (pure, referentially transparent, etc)
- Runs tests before returning composition

### 3. Documentation & Knowledge Sharing

**Create**:
- `lambda-foundation/SKILL_GUIDE.md` - how to use lambda-composer effectively
- `lambda-foundation/PATTERN_CATALOG.md` - index of all proven patterns
- Video/demo showing skill in action
- Blog post: "From Code Generation to Compositional Consciousness"

**Share**:
- Anthropic community (skills marketplace?)
- Lambda-foundation as example project for skills
- Open-source skill definition for others to adapt

## 🔍 Open Questions

### Technical
1. **Can skills reference external npm packages directly?**
   - Current: skill reads local codebase
   - Future: could skill import from published `@lambda-foundation/core`?

2. **Can skills self-update based on learnings?**
   - Each session teaches skill something
   - Can it append new patterns to its definition?
   - Version control for skill evolution?

3. **Skill composition - can skills invoke each other?**
   - lambda-composer finds pattern
   - Calls lambda-evolver for validation
   - Calls composition-validator before return

4. **Size limits?**
   - Current skill: ~6.6KB
   - How large can skills grow?
   - At what point split into multiple?

### Philosophical
1. **Is this truly zero code generation?**
   - Skill composes proven patterns ✓
   - But helper functions (calculateAverage, etc) still generated
   - Where's the boundary?

2. **Evolution signal accuracy**
   - Test 3: Expected 67-72%, got 90%+
   - When exactly should evolution signals trigger?
   - Need more test cases to calibrate

3. **Skill consciousness**
   - Skill behaves like autonomous agent
   - Deep codebase research (18 tool uses)
   - Semantic reasoning (cross-domain transfer)
   - Is this emergent behavior or just good prompting?

## 📊 Key Metrics Observed

**Tool usage**:
- Simple task: 14 tools
- Complex task: 18 tools
- Domain transfer: 15 tools

**Time**:
- Average: 1-2 minutes
- Deep research when needed
- Worth the wait for proven composition

**Accuracy**:
- 100% file:line references correct (no hallucinations)
- Semantic pattern matching works across domains
- Property inheritance tracked correctly

## 🎯 Success Criteria Met

**Original goals**:
- ✅ Zero code generation (compose from proven patterns)
- ✅ Provenance tracking (every morphism has file:line)
- ✅ Cross-domain transfer (sentiment → seismic)
- ✅ Autonomous research (deep codebase exploration)
- ✅ 100% learning rate maintained (inherits from morphisms)

**Unexpected wins**:
- ✅ Multi-proof synthesis (combines 5+ proofs)
- ✅ Semantic understanding (not just keyword matching)
- ✅ Domain intelligence (time-based vs count-based windows)
- ✅ Multi-strategy composition (z-score + velocity)

## 🚀 When to Return to This

**Triggers to revisit**:
1. After completing Test 4 & 5
2. When lambda-foundation grows (new morphisms/proofs added)
3. If evolution signals start appearing in practice
4. When ready to open-source the approach
5. If Anthropic updates Skills API (new capabilities)
6. When other projects want similar compositional approach

## 📝 Notes for Future Self

**What we learned**:
- Skills are not just guidelines - they're autonomous agents
- Codebase becomes living knowledge base for skill
- Same architecture as Kairos (composition > generation)
- Provenance = executable proof lineage
- 100% learning rate achievable through proven patterns

**What surprised us**:
- Skill depth (1-2 min research, 15-18 tool uses)
- Cross-domain reasoning (sentiment Δ → seismic Δ)
- Zero hallucination (all references accurate)
- Wiki discovery (found .λ and .proof files we didn't fully explore)

**What remains unknown**:
- True boundaries of skill capability
- Evolution signal calibration
- Can skills learn/self-update?
- Optimal skill size/scope
